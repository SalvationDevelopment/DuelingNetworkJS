DuelingNetworkJS
================

Websocket based implementation of DuelingNetwork

For the moment the system will require Node-Webkit to be its browser to develop the client untill DN is ready to implement the websocket protocol itself. With the exception of that no other nodejs code should be used.

Simply open the application and you should be able to view the application. Only works for Windows currently.

Use your DN login to login.
